TaskMaster: A Full-Stack Web Design Capstone Project

Overview:
This project involves the development of a full-stack web application, TaskMaster, designed to serve as a comprehensive task management system. The application will incorporate modern web development concepts, including Node.js, Express.js, database integration, RESTful APIs, and an intuitive front-end interface. The focus is on creating a secure, scalable, and high-performance solution.

Project Objective

Develop a task management system enabling users to:

Create, update, and delete tasks.

Organize tasks by priority and deadlines.

Search and filter tasks efficiently.


The system will emphasize security, usability, and performance optimization.


---

Technology Stack

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MongoDB (NoSQL) or PostgreSQL (SQL)

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript



---

Key Functionalities

User Registration and Authentication:

Implement secure user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or session-based mechanisms.

Employ bcrypt for password hashing to ensure data security.



Task Management Features:

Support task creation with attributes such as title, description, deadline, and priority levels (Low, Medium, High).

Enable users to update and delete tasks efficiently.



Task Filtering and Search:

Provide functionality to filter tasks based on priority or due date.

Integrate a search feature to locate tasks using keywords in titles or descriptions.





---

Development Phases

Backend Development:

Establish a server with Node.js and Express to handle all task management API requests.

Adhere to RESTful API design principles to structure endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks.

Implement CRUD operations with seamless database connectivity (MongoDB/PostgreSQL).


Database Design:

Schema:

Define a robust schema to manage user and task relationships effectively.

Collections/Tables:

Users: Stores user credentials and profiles.

Tasks: Contains task details, including user association.



Database Selection:

Utilize MongoDB for NoSQL flexibility or PostgreSQL for relational database reliability.



Frontend Development:

Design an intuitive and visually appealing user interface for managing tasks.

Integrate AJAX or Fetch API to facilitate asynchronous communication with the backend.

Leverage event listeners to handle user interactions such as task creation, updates, and deletions.


Asynchronous Operations and Error Handling:

Ensure efficient handling of asynchronous processes like task creation and updates using promises and async/await.

Implement comprehensive error handling strategies:

Client-Side: Manage validation errors and provide user-friendly feedback.

Server-Side: Handle API errors, database issues, and server exceptions gracefully.

Deliverables

Upon completion, TaskMaster will exemplify a professionally developed full-stack application, demonstrating a seamless integration of back-end and front-end technologies while adhering to best practices in software engineering.
